# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.
First, you need to fork the inital repository to make sure that you will have premissions to push code up to the repository once you make changes. After forking the repo, you then clone it to your machine. You need to make sure that you are in the correct directory before you clone the repository. From there, all you need to do is add some change toe the files from the repo, then push them up to the forked repo, at least i think so.
